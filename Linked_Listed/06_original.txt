/**************************************************************
 EE2120 Data Structure
 Programming Exercise #6 working template

 Goals:
	This program assignment is to have you practice the implementations
	and operations of Stack, Queue, and Linear List using singly linked
	lists.

	In this program, we push each characters of your student ID into a
	stack sequentially, then pop out the characters from the stack and 
	add into a queue. Afer that, we delete the characters from the queue 
	and push them into the 2nd stack. Finally, pop out the characters from
	the 2nd stack and insert them into a list sequentially. At the end of
	the program, the list is printed out and that would be your student ID.
